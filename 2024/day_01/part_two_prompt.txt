Adhere strictly to the following rules:

1. The programming language is JavaScript ES6.
2. The execution context is Node.js version 20.
3. The program must be in one code block that is enclosed in backticks.
4. The program must be a ES6 module that exports the main function as the default.
5. The main function of the program must have an input parameter that expects an UTF-8 encoded string.
6. The main function of the program must return the result.
7. Every JavaScript function must have a valid and complete JSDoc comment.
8. Do not give any explanation outside the code block.
9. Check the implementation with the provided unit test.

The program must fulfill the following unit test:

```JavaScript
assert.deepStrictEqual(
    await main(
`3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3`
    ),
    31
)
```

Write a concise program that solves the last part of the following task:

--- Part Two ---
Your analysis only confirmed what everyone feared: the two lists of location IDs are indeed very different.

Or are they?

The Historians can't agree on which group made the mistakes or how to read most of the Chief's handwriting, but in the commotion you notice an interesting detail: a lot of location IDs appear in both lists! Maybe the other numbers aren't location IDs at all but rather misinterpreted handwriting.

This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.

Here are the same example lists again:

3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:

The first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.
The second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.
The third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).
The fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.
The fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.
The last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.
So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).

Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?
