Adhere strictly to the following rules:

1. The programming language is JavaScript ES6.
2. The execution context is Node.js version 20.
3. The program must be in one code block that is enclosed in backticks.
4. The program must be a ES6 module that exports the main function as the default.
5. The main function of the program must have an input parameter that expects an UTF-8 encoded string.
6. The main function of the program must return the result.
7. Every JavaScript function must have a valid and complete JSDoc comment.
8. Do not give any explanation outside the code block.
9. Check the implementation with the provided unit test.

The program must fulfill the following unit test:

```JavaScript
assert.deepStrictEqual(
    await main(
`7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9`
    ),
    4
);
```

Write a concise program that solves the last part of the following task:

```
--- Part Two ---
The engineers are surprised by the low number of safe reports until they realize they forgot to tell you about the Problem Dampener.

The Problem Dampener is a reactor-mounted module that lets the reactor safety systems tolerate a single bad level in what would otherwise be a safe report. It's like the bad level never happened!

Now, the same rules apply as before, except if removing a single level from an unsafe report would make it safe, the report instead counts as safe.

More of the above example's reports are now safe:

7 6 4 2 1: Safe without removing any level.
1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
1 3 2 4 5: Safe by removing the second level, 3.
8 6 4 4 1: Safe by removing the third level, 4.
1 3 6 7 9: Safe without removing any level.
Thanks to the Problem Dampener, 4 reports are actually safe!

Update your analysis by handling situations where the Problem Dampener can remove a single level from unsafe reports. How many reports are now safe?
```
